This is a Gsd algorythm in Tcl realized recursively
To compile write 'make' in terminal
Then write 'make run' to run programm
After type 'make clean' to clan all excessive files 
Input files name is inputGcd.txt 
Each line is one test 
They are given in format "first_number space second_number"
like this:
12 54
You can see compared answers of algorithm and golden answers in resultsGcd.txt
